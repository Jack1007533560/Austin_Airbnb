[Dani Arribas-Bel](http://darribas.org) is Lecturer in Geographic Data Science
and member of
the Geographic Data Science Lab at the University of Liverpool (UK). Dani is
interested in 
undestanding cities as well as in the quantitative and computational methods
required 
to leverage the power of the 
large amount of urban data increasingly becoming available. He is also part of
the team
of core developers of PySAL, the open-source library written in Python for
spatial
analysis. Dani regularly teaches Geographic Data Science and Python courses at
the 
University of Liverpool and has designed and developed several workshops at
different
levels on spatial analysis and econometrics, Python and open source scientific
computing.
